Neuarl networks are smarter than traditional algorithms for identifying objects in images.

Input layer-> hidden layers -> output layers

more than 2 layers -> Deep neural networks
less than 2 layers -> shallow neural networks 

Neural networks are task specific programming.
identifying a dog in a crowd.
training the model with dog images and try to identify by giving the probabilities of the presence of dog.

Neural networks learns by itself by reiterating the process by backpropagation. It adjusts the weightage of the features and checks the accuracies accordingly.

OpenCV -> yolo package is a deep learning model.

Object classification and detection:

* Data should be scaled before applying it to model.

1. Input layer
2. Hidden layer 1
3. Hidden layer 2
4. output layer
5. compile the ANN
loss function is to measure the model accuracy and predcit the best model.
classifier.compile(

6. fitting the model
classifier.fit(x_train,y_train, batch_size=10, nb_epoch = 100)

Training the /neural network :
Error :
if the error increases with the weight or if it increases with the decrease in the weight.
